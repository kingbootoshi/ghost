ok i just finished adding in functionality for ghost to add things to calendar thru:
- giving him 24 hour clock of current time in PST
- forcing formatting to be correct in calendar (seems good so far)
- he automatically schedules himself a perception which runs 30 minutes prior to an added event to remind you of it 

05-21 8 pm pst:
... just realized i need base ghost to be UTC and easily take in other users timezones

add timezone picking to the initial character creation

then add all the logics for it

this probably includes adding in the timezone FROM soul memory in the calendar step

not too bad minor setback all gucci!
