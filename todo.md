ok i just finished adding in functionality for ghost to add things to calendar thru:
- giving him 24 hour clock of current time in PST
- forcing formatting to be correct in calendar (seems good so far)
- he automatically schedules himself a perception which runs 30 minutes prior to an added event to remind you of it
